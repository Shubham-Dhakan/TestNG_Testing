# TestNG_Testing
@Test ---> Annotations Concept and how it is superor to JAVA and we can create multiple TestCases in TestNG with help of annotations 
What is TestNG.xml? ---> IF we want to run all the test cases together then we can use testng.xml file to perform that action, 
even we can prioritize test cases in testng.xml if we want to include or exclude specific file in testing.
